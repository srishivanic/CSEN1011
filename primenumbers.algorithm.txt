Algorithm to find whether a number is prime or composite
1. Start
2. Accept a positive integer 'n' (number greater than 2)
3. Initialize 'counter' with a value 2
4. Divide 'n' with the counter
5. If the remainder is 0 diaplay that 'n' is composite and stop the algorithm
6. Else increment the 'counter' and repeat from step 4 until the 'counter' value is less than 'n'
7. After completion of all the steps display that the number 'n' is prime
8. Stop
